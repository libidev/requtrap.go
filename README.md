# Configuration
You can configure RequTrap by creating a YAML file which 
contain configuration schema. It will look like example below.

```yml
name: book-store
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 8080
services:
  - path: /books
    upstream: http://127.0.0.1:8001
  - path: /authors
    upstream: http://127.0.0.1:8002
.
.
.
```

If you want to configure CORS, just put example bellow
at bottom of YAML configuration file.

```yml
.
.
.
cors:
  enable: true
  methods:
    - GET
    - POST
    - PUT
    - DELETE
  origins:
    - http://localhost:3000

.
.
```

If your authentication service using JWT (JSON Web Token),
just give little information on API gateway config. 

```yml
.
.
.
authentication:
  type: jwt
  upstream: http://localhost:8000/auth
  path:
    - http://localhost:8001/
    - http://localhost:8002/
